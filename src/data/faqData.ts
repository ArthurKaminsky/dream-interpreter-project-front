        q: "How does Luna's AI dream interpretation work?",
        a: "Luna uses advanced neural networks trained on millions of dream patterns, psychological research, and symbolic meanings across cultures. When you describe your dream, our AI analyzes the narrative structure, identifies key symbols, emotional patterns, and archetypal themes to provide you with a comprehensive interpretation that combines psychological insights with spiritual wisdom."
      },
      {
        q: "Is my dream data private and secure?",
        a: "Absolutely. Your privacy is our top priority. All dream descriptions are encrypted end-to-end and are never stored on our servers. Each interpretation session is completely ephemeral - once you leave the page, your dream data is permanently deleted. We use military-grade encryption and never share your information with third parties."
      },
      {
        q: "How accurate are the dream interpretations?",
        a: "Luna's interpretations are based on extensive research in psychology, neuroscience, and dream symbolism.

        q: "What types of dreams can Luna interpret?",
        a: "Luna can interpret all types of dreams including recurring dreams, nightmares, lucid dreams, prophetic dreams, and symbolic dreams. Our AI is trained to recognize patterns in anxiety dreams, wish-fulfillment dreams, problem-solving dreams, and even abstract or surreal dream sequences. The more detail you provide, the more accurate the interpretation."
      },
      {
        q: "Should I include emotions and colors in my dream description?",

Colors often carry symbolic meanings (e.g., red for passion or anger, blue for calm or sadness), while emotions provide context for the dream's psychological significance. Include how you felt during and after the dream for the most comprehensive analysis."
